🔷 Business Problem (Crisp & Boardroom-Ready)
cx
In a hypercompetitive OTT ecosystem, where content supply far exceeds demand, only a small fraction of titles achieve high ratings, popularity, and sustained audience engagement. Identifying the factors that differentiate high-performing content from low-performing content is critical for optimizing production decisions, maximizing ROI, and improving consumer satisfaction.

🔷 Key Insights (This Is the Gold)
📌 Content Performance

Only 5–10% of total content achieves high IMDb & TMDB scores

Indicates strong underlying success patterns, not randomness

📌 Genre Intelligence

Documentary, History, and Music genres score highest on quality metrics

Animation, Sci-Fi, Fantasy dominate popularity but not necessarily ratings

High production volume ≠ high popularity (e.g., Drama)

📌 Runtime Optimization

90–120 minutes is the sweet spot:

Highest median IMDb & TMDB scores

Strongest popularity and voting metrics

Very long runtimes (>180 mins) underperform consistently

📌 Geography & Market Strategy

US leads in high-quality content volume

India shows strong growth in post-2000 high-rated movies

UK and Europe contribute niche, quality-focused content

📌 Actor Impact

Actors with repeated high-scoring appearances correlate strongly with popularity

Star power remains a measurable performance lever

📌 Ratings vs Popularity

IMDb & TMDB scores show moderate positive correlation

Popularity ≠ quality → both must be balanced for profitability
