8. Key Insights

Only 5–10% of content scores high on IMDB & TMDB.

US and India produce most high-rated movies; the UK follows.

Animation is most popular by TMDB popularity, though drama has more volume.

Medium runtime (90–120 min) performs best in terms of ratings.

Popular actors attract larger audience and increase engagement.

High-voted movies are not always top-scoring; scores and votes should be considered together.
